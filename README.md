# Project-5-Portfolio-with-SQLAlchemy

TITLE: Michael Jones Portfolio with SQLAlchemy

DESCRIPTION: This project is using all I've learnt about Python, HTML, CSS, Flask and SQLAlchemy to create a portfolio website. This contains
a database of all the projects I've completed throughout the course.

HOW TO RUN LOCALLY: To run this project locally, download the files from GitHub (https://github.com/Jonesy90/Project-5-Portfolio-with-SQLAlchemy),
open a Terminal and run the following command whilst you're inside the main directory of the application: source ./env/bin/activate

Once this is running, it will create a server for you to run this website locally.

WHAT I HAVE LEARN'T: I've learned a lot about Python, the connections between HTML, CSS and Python to create a portfolio website.
